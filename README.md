# Titanic Web Apps

This repository is an attempt to demonstrate several ways to serve the same machine learning model through various application frameworks and tools. The sample model in this repo is a Support Vector Classifier trained on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The aim of the classifier is to predict whether or not a person would have survived the sinking of the ship Titanic based on a few parameters, such as age and gender. The apps in this repository provide a user interface to input the parameters and output the prediction of the classifier.
